Study with me
=============

A simple pomodoro "study with me app" to render a counter and a progress bar. Ideal for use on software such as OBS.

Visit [stdywith.me/settings](stdywith.me/settings) to customise it.

## Contributing

As of now, there are no strict guidelines, there is, however a *"vision"*. I would like this app to be as **lightweight as possible**, while offering a broad set of options to whoever wants to use a pomodoro application.

The app should work in two modes: on-stream and standalone.

 - **On-stream** is meant to be used as a browser source in streaming programs such as OBS or Streamlabs.
 - **Standalone** is meant to be used as a traditional web app, in a browser.

Please [check the issues](https://github.com/fferegrino/study-with-me/issues) for things to do or to add your own ideas, but **please reach out to me** before writing actual code.
